## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?
- What went easier than expected?
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

I'm having trouble figuring out what to do with the state labels. It just seems silly to have them all showing like they are right now, because they're all on top of one another. I tried looking up how to make them hidden and then appear on hover or mouseover, but I couldn't really figure it out. 


Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
